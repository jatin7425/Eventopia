# Eventopia

Eventopia is a full-stack event management platform built to connect event organizers with vendors, service providers, and attendees. Whether it's a wedding, a family function, a corporate meeting, or a roadshow, the platform helps organizers manage their events end-to-end.

## Project Motivation

When I moved to a new city, I found it difficult to organize any event due to a lack of local contacts. I didn’t know any decorators, caterers, or venue managers, and this made planning events extremely challenging.

This experience inspired me to create Eventopia — a platform that helps event organizers find trusted vendors, invite attendees, and track responses, all through a centralized system.

## Features

- User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Invite attendees via email, even if they are not registered
- Vendors can register and list products or services
- Organizers can track attendee responses and manage headcounts
- Role-based interfaces for organizers, vendors, and attendees

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## My Role

- Led the project as team leader
- Designed the complete system architecture
- Developed the entire backend logic including APIs, data models, and business flow
- Contributed 30% of the frontend functionality using React

This project was developed as part of my final year academic curriculum. I independently handled the backend and played a major role in the frontend. It was awarded a perfect score of 100 out of 100.

## Disclaimer

This project was built solely for academic purposes and is not currently maintained. It reflects my ability to design scalable backend systems, manage teams, and implement real-world features.
